# ad-decider
Created by James Hinks, 5/6/2023

This code was the final assignment for the CSCI 428 course I took in 2023.
The data used for this code comes from David Zendle, Rachel Meyer, and Harriet Over from the University of York and York St. John University, and can be found publically at https://osf.io/ts7ue/
This code is not designed to be implemented for any actual use, its purpose was to get practice in coding basic A.I. as well as to demonstrate an ethical dilemna in A.I.  By designing code to determine if advertisements should be shown to an individual based on specific metrics and then relating those metrics to determine if theres a correlation to a predisposition to problem gambling, this code can be used to shown if the targetted advertisements should be considered unethical.
